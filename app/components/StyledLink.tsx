/**
 * Here, we'd like to use radix's Link component, to ensure that the styles stay
 * consistent, and always matches the theme.
 * However, we also want to use next's Link to ensure we are not reloading the
 * page on navigation, i.e. we are doing client side navigation.
 * For these 2 to work together, we need to do the following:
 * 
 * If the child of Link is a custom component that wraps an <a> tag,
 * you must add passHref to Link.
 * This is necessary if youâ€™re using libraries like styled-components.
 * Without this, the <a> tag will not have the href attribute,
 * which hurts your site's accessibility and might affect SEO.
 * If you're using ESLint, there is a built-in rule next/link-passhref
 * to ensure correct usage of passHref.
